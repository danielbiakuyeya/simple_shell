Hello, I'm Daniel Biakuyeya, the creator of this Simple Shell project!

About Me
I am a passionate computer science enthusiast with a keen interest in system programming, operating systems, and the intricate details of how computers work at the lower levels. This Simple Shell project was born out of a desire to deepen my understanding of shell mechanics and explore the world of command-line interfaces.

Motivation
The motivation behind building this Simple Shell was to delve into the fundamentals of shell programming, understand how commands are executed, and grasp the nuances of process management. It's my attempt to create a minimalistic yet functional shell that serves both as a learning resource and a starting point for others interested in exploring similar areas.
